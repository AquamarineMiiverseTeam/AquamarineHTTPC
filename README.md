# Pretendo patches for http:C

I figured it wouldn't be a huge problem if I made the repo public since its gonna be public eventually anyways, but dont ask for help with it until its actually done and merged into nimbus


This basically does realtime replacement of nintendo.net/nintendowifi.net -> pretendo.cc

It depends on what branch you're looking at really
